    "   access or modify those data members, you can achieve data abstraction in Python.\n",
    "\n",

    "   computed dynamically. By using properties to encapsulate data, you can hide the implementation details\n",
    "   from the user and provide a more abstract interface to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Using Modules: Modules are a way to group related functions and data together into a single namespace. \n",
    "   By exposing only the relevant functions and data through the module's interface, you can achieve a \n",
    "    level of data abstraction in Python.\n",
    "\n",
